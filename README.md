# Uni-Team-Project
A Java project developed as part of a 5 man team.
The project was built as a standalone Java application using the IntelliJ GUI builder for graphical views connected to a MySQL database.

I was lead developer on the project and contributed most of the backend business logic, with some assistance developing the forms and page views.
Other team members focussed on the design stages and report writing.
